  /**
   *   Returns the Perlin noise value at specified

   *   generator producing a more natural ordered, 
   *   harmonic succession of numbers compared to the 
   *   standard random() function. It was invented by Ken 
   *   Perlin in the 1980s and been used since in 
   *   graphical applications to produce procedural 
   *   textures, natural motion, shapes, terrains etc. 
   *   The main difference to the random() function is 
   *   that Perlin noise is defined in an infinite 
   *   n-dimensional space where each pair of coordinates 
   *   corresponds to a fixed semi-random value (fixed 
   *   only for the lifespan of the program; see the 
   *   noiseSeed() function). p5.js can compute 1D, 2D 
   *   and 3D noise, depending on the number of 
   *   coordinates given. The resulting value will always 
   *   be between 0.0 and 1.0. The noise value can be 
   *   animated by moving through the noise space as 
   *   demonstrated in the example above. The 2nd and 3rd 
   *   dimension can also be interpreted as time.
   * 
   *   The actual noise is structured similar to an audio 
   *   signal, in respect to the function's use of 
   *   frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics 
   *   in physics, perlin noise is computed over several 
   *   octaves which are added together for the final 
   *   result. 
   * 
   *   Another way to adjust the character of the 
   *   resulting sequence is the scale of the input 
   *   coordinates. As the function works within an 
   *   infinite space the value of the coordinates 
   *   doesn't matter as such, only the distance between 
   *   successive coordinates does (eg. when using 
   *   noise() within a loop). As a general rule the 
   *   smaller the difference between coordinates, the 
   *   smoother the resulting noise sequence will be. 
   *   Steps of 0.005-0.03 work best for most 
   *   applications, but this will differ depending on 
   *   use.

   *   output signal and as such define the overall 
   *   intensity of the noise, whereas higher octaves 
   *   create finer grained details in the noise 
   *   sequence.  By default, noise is computed over 4 
   *   octaves with each octave contributing exactly half 
   *   than its predecessor, starting at 50% strength for 
   *   the 1st octave. This falloff amount can be changed

   *   falloff factor of 0.75 means each octave will now
